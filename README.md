## Description

This project focused on creating a schedule to help stay organized during work hours

This was done by:

-Building out timeblock in HTML and CSS using Bootstrap to help.\
-Utilizing javaScript to track the date and time to keep the schedule up to date.\
-Building functinality in javascript and HTML to take user input and commit the data to local storage so the data can be persistent.

This was done because:

-Keeping track of important tasks is important to be efficent.\
-It can be easy to get caught up in other work and forget upcoming responsibilities.
